# Level JSON Guidelines
The individual level pages are automatically generated based on the JSON files for the respective levels.
The file `level.html` is a template HTML file that is populated with level data via the `injectLevelData()` function, depending on the level in the URL.
For this reason, the JSON level files must follow a particular format in order for the injection to work properly. The guidelines for each
individual game are below.

## Games
1. [Banjo-Kazooie](#banjo-kazooie)
2. [Banjo-Tooie](#banjo-tooie)

### Important things to note
- The video fields for each trick contain *embed* links, not normal video links (note the `/embed`)
- If there is no video or image for a trick, don't include those fields in the trick's object
- If there are no tricks in a particular category (like `"outofbounds"` above), leave its list empty
- You can run your JSON through [this tool](https://jsonlint.com/?code=) to check its validity

### Below is an xxample of how the JSON files relate to the page
